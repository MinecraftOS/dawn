Dawn Kernel
By Dusk
Development start (1.0.0): Tuesday June 6th, 2023 at 9:00PM
Development end (1.0.0): TBD

+==========================================================+

What is this?

It's a CC OS kernel, coming with a filesystem, custom terminal, libraries, programs, and a configs folder right out of the box.
it's a very heavy WIP, so do be patient. I will also provide an installer script to put in your OS installer so that you don't need to
have your theoretical end user run two installers, or even have your script run a second installer.

Will you code absolutely everything on your own?

Oh absolutely not. I'll obviously code things like the kernel and terminal myself, but anything that isn't signed personally is from
someone probably far more talented than me. In terms of using libraries and such from others, they will be added via the 'libsinstall'
script on the release branch. In this branch, however, they will just be there as the libraries themselves for developmental purposes.
There won't be an idev install snippet, if you want the idev stuff, get it yourself with wgets.

Will you be open to contributions?

Absolutely! This code is probably hot garbage and absolutely inneficient, and people who are better at efficient code can help fix my
garbage code. I reccomend just making pull requests, and I'll double check they work as described on my local copy, then once it's
verified, I'll make the merge happen.

What are the rules for contributions?

For contributing, I have just a few rules.

1. When making a pull/merge request, make sure to state what the code does and (if applicable) how to trigger the code.
2. Watch your language (obviously).
3. Always make sure to also test on a local copy to double check before trying to commit.
