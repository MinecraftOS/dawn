I take free software seriously.
Especially my own.

+==========================================================+

Dawn was originally a project coming right off the heels of CC-Linux, one of my old projects. 
The idea was a CC OS kernel, but it ended up steamrolling into a full blown *NIX-Like OS for CC,
ith all the features and such. Everything in the idev branch is WIP, while everything in release
is fully stable and finished up. Of course, there's nothing in release yet, as this project is still
a WIP.

Current notable features:
- A very cluttered /etc/
- A decentralized logging system
- 3 libraries
- Two terminals
- like seriously /etc/ is a damn mess
- A registry
- /bin/ is notable ig
- package manager (pkg)
- A lot of bad and inneficient code, most of this damn thing needs a good rewrite

+==========================================================+

How to contribute:

1. Issues in Github
Open the issues tab and submit an issue if you find a bug. I (or anyone willing) will look into it and get it fixed ASAP.

2. Forking and pull requesting
Fork the repo, make changes, then make a pull request. Code will be reviewed before acceptance.

3. Commiting to the repo directly
If you ask nicely, you can.

Making up to 3 useful commits, pull requests and/or issues, you can be added to the list of contributors who can contribute
to the repo directly.

Only two exceptions I've made are Ocawesome and TheAio, for both of them being very helpful throughout dawn's development
